## Implementation: a semi-procedural/event-driven approach

All the HTML (except the boilerplate of course) is generated by ``rilti.dom['tag']``.
The todo items are managed and saved by event hooks using ``rilti.model(localStorage.getItem('todos'))`` and so on.
Fairly straight forward, everything is under 200 LOC.
